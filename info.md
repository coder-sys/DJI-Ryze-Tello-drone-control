# DJI-Ryze-Tello-drone-control

The module dji is a package created by me that can be used to educate children or coders interested in the field of programming and flight control.
This package gives a variety of accesses to the Tello drone's attachments.After uploading the script the flight will be capable of taking images and can 
be monitored from far.The package is useful,easy to learn and more can be done.The process of editing the script is easy allowing you make changes and
the basic purpose of this is education.

Tello drone
